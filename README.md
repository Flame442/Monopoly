# Monopoly

*The current form of this project is playable, but not user friendly at all. Probably a soft lock or two somewhere I haven't noticed yet.

Hello who ever found my project! Feel free to suggest changes to my horrible code if you can even read it. 

To play, run monopoly.py on any computer with python 3 installed, or at https://repl.it/@Flame442/Monopoly
